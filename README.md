# MoreFuel

#### This is a simple mod that adds in a few custom fuels and makes a few vanilla items usable as fuels, as well.

At the moment the mod adds in:

Item  | Usage
------------- | -------------
Nether Brick Dust | Used to make Nether Brick Coal.
Nether Brick Coal | Burns for 240s
Glowing Coal      | Burns for 160s
Blazing Coal      | Burns for 540s

And makes the following usable as fuels:

Item | Usage
------------- | -------------
Magma Cream   | Burns for 240s
Blaze Powder  | Burns for 120s
Fire Charge   | Burns for 160s

#### Don't be afraid to suggest some ideas for new fuels, as well as modifications to current recipes and burn times.
